# Bluetooth Time

Hear the time when your wireless headphones connect.

Edit your device name, the one you see in your bluetooth menu, in
`src/bluetooth_time/luc/breceiver.java` (line 26).

Build using `run.sh`, which calls `../run.sh` from
<https://github.com/lgommans/android-basic-build-environment>

When leaving from/to work, I put on my wireless headphones. Since I have a
train to catch, I want to know whether I need to run, or whether I have plenty
of time left. Rather than looking at my pocket watch (I mean my phone), I
thought having the time announced would be a more pleasant experience.
